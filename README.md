This tracker is designed to replace your character sheet. 
Take your character sheet with you, where ever you are. 

This is currently Beta and I expect some issues. I recommend tracking your character on a sheet while using this and then comparing the sheet to the program at the start of each session. 

If this gets popularity then I will create a mobile app so you can take your campaign with you on your phone. 

Issues, Concerns, Comments can be sent to nlandefeld1995@gmail.com
